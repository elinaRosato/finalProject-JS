# Todo List
This is the first time I'm working with JavaScript. This time I created a web app to create lists. It's the final version of a project I have been working on during my course on Coderhouse. I hope you like it!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

As a good virgo, I am the queen of lists. That's why I decided to create this web app where I built in all the functionalities mentioned below using pure Vanilla Javascript:

* Create up to 3 lists at the same time.
* Be able to delete each list.
* Be able to edit the list title.
* Add tasks on each list.
* Be able to delete each task.
* Be able to delete all tasks at once.
* Be able to mark each task as checked and back to unchecked.
* Be able to edit the task.
* Drag and drop tasks inside each list.
* Get a reminder to take a coffee when I try to create more than 3 lists.
